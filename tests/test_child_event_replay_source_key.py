Tests for S-08: Pass ownerKey as sourceKey in child event replay.

Bug: When session_fork flushes buffered child events via
pendingChildEventsRef, it calls handleWsMessage(bufferedMsg) without
passing sourceKey. If the active session has changed since the events
were buffered, they get routed to the wrong session.

Fix: Pass ownerKey as the second argument so replayed events always
target the correct parent session:
  handleWsMessage(bufferedMsg, ownerKey);
