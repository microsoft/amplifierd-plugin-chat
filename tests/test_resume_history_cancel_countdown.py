Tests for S-05: Defensive cancelCountdown call at top of resumeHistorySession.

Bug: resumeHistorySession can be called while a countdown is active on the
current session. Without an explicit cancelCountdown call, the countdown
timer continues running even after switching to a history session, causing
phantom UI updates.

Fix: Add cancelCountdown(activeKeyRef.current) as the first statement inside
resumeHistorySession, before any early-return guards.
